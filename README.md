# Java WGU Software 1 Fall 2020

## Project Description
Software 1 project that I completed in Fall 2020 for the C482 course at Western Governors University.  
Every student is given the same set of requirements for this project, which can be found [here](../MWilliams99-patch-1/ProjectRequirements.md).

This project has the student create a program that will display parts and products that the user can add through forms in the program. Parts can exist on their own, and products are made up of parts. Part and product objects only persist throughout the time that the program is open, once the program has been closed any added parts and products no longer exist.

The Part.java file is provided and is untouched by the student. 

## Acknowledgements
This project is included as part of my portfolio to showcase the skills learned throughout my time at WGU.  
This is not meant for any other student to directly copy. However, if looking through the way I coded and solved the project requirements helps understand possible ways to complete the project yourself, then I am glad to help.
